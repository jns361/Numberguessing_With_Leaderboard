❓ Number Guessing Minigame / First Python project

Here I have uploaded my first small Python project - a simple number guessing game - to get started with coding!

❓ How to use
- Make sure you have installed Python 3.
- If not, you can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download the code as a zip via the green button.
- Unpack the zip file
- Right click the .py file and "Open with" -> "Python"
- The .txt file should be created automatically when finished the game once (same folder as the .py file)

🗺️ Roadmap
- Different difficulty settings (increasing the range of possible numbers)
- Build a GUI using Tkinter

🎮 How it works
- The game randomly generates a number **from 1 to 100**.
- Right before starting to guess it asks you for your name.
- Your guesses are **counted in the background**.
- When guessing correctly:
    1. Your entered name and the number of attempts are saved to a local file.
    2. A **local leaderboard** is displayed, sorted by **lowest attempts**.
- To reset saved scores, find the folder where you have saved the .py file, open the **winners.txt** file and delete everything out of it.

🛠️ Data Handling and technology
- All winner names and number of attempts are saved to the **winners.txt**.
- The leaderboard updates every time there is a new winner.
- Use of **Python 3**
- **No** external libraries are required

💡 Why I made this
It helped me getting an idea of:
- Python basics
- Working with loops, functions and files
- Using AI just right (gave me small hints when I was stuck, did not give me whole code pieces etc.)
