❓ Number Guessing Minigame / First Python project

Here I have uploaded my first small Python project - a simple number guessing game - to get started with coding!

🎮 How it works
- The game randomly generates a number **from 1 to 100**.
- Right before starting to guess it asks you for your name.
- Your guesses are **counted in the background**.
- When guessing correctly:
    1. Your entered name and the number of attempts are saved to a local file.
    2. A **local leaderboard** is displayed, sorted by **lowest attempts**.

🛠️ Data Handling and technology
- All winner names and number of attempts are saved to the **winners.txt**.
- The leaderboard updates every time there is a new winner.
- Use of **Python 3**
- **No** external libraries are required

💡 Why I made this
It helped me getting an idea of:
- Python basics
- Working with loops, functions and files
- Using AI just right (gave me small hints when I was stuck, did not give me whole code pieces etc.)
